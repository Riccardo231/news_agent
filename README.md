## ‚ö° Installation

Clone the repo and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pinperepette/news_agent.git
cd news_agent
pip install .

news-agent
```

## üîß Configuration

### Quick Setup

#### üöÄ Fast Start with Claude (Recommended)
1. Get your Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Edit `news_agent/settings.ini`:
   ```ini
   provider = claude
   claude_api_key = sk-ant-your-key-here
   ```
3. Run: `python -m news_agent.main`

#### üè† Local Setup with Ollama
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Run: `ollama pull qwen2:7b-instruct`
3. Edit `news_agent/settings.ini`:
   ```ini
   provider = ollama
   model = qwen2:7b-instruct
   ```
4. Run: `python -m news_agent.main`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Built-in Settings Manager

**NEW**: You can now modify all settings directly from the UI!

1. **Press `c`** in the main menu to open the configuration panel
2. **Select what to modify**:
   - Provider AI (ollama/openai/claude)
   - AI models for each provider
   - API keys (OpenAI, Claude, SerpAPI)
   - General settings (language, RSS feed, articles per page)
   - View current configuration

**No more manual file editing required!** üéâ

### Detailed Configuration

Edit `news_agent/settings.ini`:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
lang = it
topic = https://www.ansa.it/sito/ansait_rss.xml
articles_per_page = 15
provider = ollama
model = qwen2:7b-instruct
ollama_url = http://localhost:11434/api/generate
serpapi_key = 
openai_api_key = 
claude_api_key = 
openai_model = gpt-4
claude_model = claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

### ü§ñ AI Provider System

The system uses a **factory pattern** that allows you to easily switch between different AI providers by changing just one line in the configuration.

#### How to Choose Your AI Provider

Simply change the `provider =` line in `settings.ini`:

```ini
# For Ollama (local, free)
provider = ollama

# For OpenAI (cloud, paid)
provider = openai

# For Claude (cloud, paid)
provider = claude
```

#### 1. Claude (Recommended - High Quality)
```ini
provider = claude
claude_api_key = sk-ant-your-claude-key-here
claude_model = claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

**Available Claude Models:**
- `claude-3-opus-20240229` - Most powerful (expensive)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - Balanced (recommended)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240926` - Alternative Sonnet
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` - Fastest (cheapest)

- **Pros**: Excellent reasoning, high quality responses, best for complex analysis
- **Cons**: Requires API key, costs money (~$0.003/1K tokens)
- **Setup**: Get API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

#### 2. Ollama (Local - Free)
```ini
provider = ollama
model = qwen2:7b-instruct
ollama_url = http://localhost:11434/api/generate
```

**Recommended Models:**
- `qwen2:7b-instruct` - Good balance of speed and quality
- `llama3.2:3b` - Fast and lightweight
- `mistral:7b` - High quality for size
- `codellama:7b` - Good for technical topics

- **Pros**: Free, private, no internet required, no API limits
- **Cons**: Requires local setup, slower than cloud options
- **Setup**: Install Ollama and run `ollama pull qwen2:7b-instruct`

#### 3. OpenAI
```ini
provider = openai
openai_api_key = sk-your-openai-key-here
openai_model = gpt-4
```

**Available Models:**
- `gpt-4` - Most powerful (expensive)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Good balance (cheaper)
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Latest GPT-4 version

- **Pros**: High quality, reliable, excellent for creative tasks
- **Cons**: Requires API key, costs money
- **Setup**: Get API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

### AI Provider Comparison

| Provider | Cost | Privacy | Quality | Speed | Setup |
|----------|------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Claude** | Pay-per-use | Cloud | Excellent | Fast | API key |
| **Ollama** | Free | 100% Private | Good | Medium | Local install |
| **OpenAI** | Pay-per-use | Cloud | Excellent | Fast | API key |

### How the AI System Works

1. **Configuration Reading**: The program reads `provider =` from `settings.ini`
2. **Provider Creation**: Creates the appropriate AI provider using `create_ai_provider()`
3. **Fallback System**: If multiple providers are configured, automatically tries alternatives if one fails
4. **Unified Interface**: All agents use the same provider for:
   - üì∞ Article summarization (`s`)
   - ü§ñ LLM agents (`a`)
   - üîç News verification (`v`)
5. **Model Name Display**: Shows which model is being used in response titles

### üîÑ Automatic Fallback System

If you have multiple AI providers configured, the system will:
1. **Try the primary provider** first
2. **Automatically switch** to the next available provider if one fails
3. **Show feedback** about which provider is being used
4. **Ensure continuity** even with temporary server errors

**Example**: If Claude returns a 529 error, the system automatically switches to OpenAI or Ollama.

### News Verification Setup

To enable the news verification feature:

1. Get a free API key from [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)
2. Add your key to `settings.ini`:
   ```ini
   serpapi_key = your_serpapi_key_here
   ```
3. The verification option (`v`) will appear in the menu

**Verification Features:**
- **Three search modes**: Fast (quick), Medium (balanced), Comprehensive (thorough)
- Searches for fact-checking information in both Italian and English
- Cross-references with reliable sources
- **Scrapes full content** of verification articles
- Uses AI to analyze truthfulness with critical skepticism
- Provides detailed verification report
- **Advanced verification** with step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought)
